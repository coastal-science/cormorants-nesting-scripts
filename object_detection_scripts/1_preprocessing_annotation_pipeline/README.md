# Pre-Processing & Annotation Pipeline
Before a model can be trained on a new dataset, that dataset must be annotated.
In this project, there was additional pre-processing work that needed to happen
prior to annotation. This folder contains the code & documented needed to
complete pre-processing and annotation.

* [Tile TIFs](tile_tifs) &mdash; large orthomosaic TIF images are divided into
  the tiles that will be annotated and used for training.
* [Select Data]()
* [Combine Annotation Labels]()
* [RAW to TIF]()
* [LOST Annotation]()
* [Collect Annotation Pools]()

Once a set of data has been annotated, it can be used within the 
[training pipeline](../2_training_pipeline).
